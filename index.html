            <dd>People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread, as well as
              with physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating. An anxiety disorder is
              diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the person cannot control the
              response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal functioning. Anxiety disorders include generalized
              anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias.</dd>

            <dd>Psychotic disorders involve distorted awareness and thinking. Two of the most common symptoms of
              psychotic disorders are hallucinations -- the experience of images or sounds that are not real, such as
              hearing voices -- and delusions, which are false fixed beliefs that the ill person accepts as true,
              despite evidence to the contrary. Schizophrenia is an example of a psychotic disorder.</dd>

              compulsive gambling are examples of impulse control disorders. Alcohol and drugs are common objects of

              that they interfere with the person's normal functioning. Examples include antisocial personality
